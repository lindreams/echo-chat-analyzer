"""Minimal local-only HTTP client for NapCat's `EchoSnapshotApi` RPC.

The Direct DB snapshot helper exposes `runtimeCore.apis.EchoSnapshotApi` over
NapCat's in-process `/rpc` bridge (`napcat_bridge_url`).  This module is a
thin client that may only invoke the three frozen methods `acquire` /
`cleanup` / `recover`:

* `acquire`    -> a fresh opaque `generation_id` for a ready snapshot
* `cleanup`    -> remove one generation by its id
* `recover`    -> remove orphan staging / legacy plaintext artifacts

It never accepts an absolute database path from the runtime.  Callers compute a
generation directory from the returned opaque id under a known snapshot root,
and the id is strictly validated so path traversal can never escape that root.
The only additional NapCat API call exposed here is the fixed
``GroupApi.getGroupMemberAll`` request used to resolve Direct DB group senders.

Privacy contract: error objects may only carry stable codes and privacy-safe
messages.  A runtime error message, the QQ UIN, nicknames, message text, the
passphrase and absolute paths never reach an exception's public message.

# ``snapshot_unstable`` is the single error code the snapshot helper returns
# whenever it refuses to publish a capture it cannot prove stable. It is a
# failure class, not one condition: it covers the whole capture path plus the
# input-stability witnesses (source location, workspace/lease, WAL
# identity/header/prefix/checksum/commit boundary, main identity, checkpoint
# witness, and the input witness taken before and after decrypt). Only the
# helper's privacy-safe ``failure_stage`` / ``guard_code`` diagnostics name the
# concrete cause.
# The cause confirmed on the affected machine was the guard
# ``main_changed_during_read`` (failure_stage ``main_stability``): the main
# database changed inside the read window. A WAL checkpoint or QQ's post-login
# sync can produce that, but so can any other concurrent writer, so the guard is
# one member of the ``snapshot_unstable`` class rather than its definition.
# That class of instability is transient, yet one attempt is not cheap: it
# re-acquires the OS lease and re-reads the whole source, so a large database
# makes a single attempt take several seconds. A three-attempt limit therefore
# expired while the source was still settling and surfaced as a permanent
# connection failure.
# Six attempts is the new maximum, but they are not six fresh timeouts: the 65s
# is the budget of the whole ``acquire()`` loop (one monotonic deadline), not the
# timeout of a single RPC, so a burst of retries can never accumulate into
# minutes of waiting. No consistency guard is relaxed: every attempt keeps the
# same all-or-nothing capture contract.
